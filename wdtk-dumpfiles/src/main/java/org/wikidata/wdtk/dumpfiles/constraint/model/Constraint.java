/**
 * This models a property constraint. It is a restriction applied to a property.
 * <p>
 * Constraints are actually templates transcluded from the property talk page.
 * They help understand the semantics of the different properties and are a
 * useful tool available to detect possible mistakes. For example, property
 * <i>occupation (P106)</i> has a constraint that says that all elements related
 * by that property have to be instances of item <i>occupation (Q13516667)</i>.
 * <p>
 * Constraints are defined and used according to common sense. They are designed
 * to be flexible regarding language ambiguity and polysemy. Exceptions in
 * constraints are at some extent beyond the purpose of this modeling.
 * <p>
 * Some constraints are violated because the exceptions are rare. Every
 * constraint has a category of properties using it and a list of violations.
 * Both, the category and the list, are useful tools to detect mistakes or
 * anomalies.
 * <p>
 * Other constraints are violated because properties used to describe fictional
 * things are the same as the ones used for real-world things. An item in a
 * fictional universe does not need to follow a real-world behavior.
