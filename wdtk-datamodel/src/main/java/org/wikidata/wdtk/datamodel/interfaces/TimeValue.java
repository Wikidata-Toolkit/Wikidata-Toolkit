/**
 * Time values represent points and intervals in time, and additional
 * information about their format. Information includes a specific time point,
 * information about its precision, and the preferred calendar model.
 * 
 * The main time point of the value generally refers to the proleptic Gregorian
 * calendar. However, if dates are imprecise (like "Jan 1512" or even "1200")
 * then one cannot convert this reliably and Wikidata will just keep the value
 * as entered. (TODO check if this is true)
 * 
 * "Y0K issue": Neither the Gregorian nor the Julian calendar assume a year 0,
 * i.e., the year 1 BCE was followed by 1 CE in these calendars. See
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_zero. Wikibase internally uses the year 0.
 * This is the same as ISO-8601, where 1 BCE is represented as "0000". However,
 * note that XML Schema dates (1.0 and 2.0) do not have a year 0, so in their
 * case 1BCE is represented as "-1". Understanding the difference is relevant
 * for computing leap years, for computing temporal intervals, and for exporting
 * data.
 * 
 * While the Wikibase export format foresees the use of concrete times of the
 * day as well as timezones, this data can not be entered into the system so
 * far. This also means that the final details of these components might still
 * change. Hence, this implementation does not support this yet.
 * 
 * It is also planned that intervals should at some point be supported by
 * specifying a "before" and "after" distance, though the semantics of this is
 * not entirely clear yet.
