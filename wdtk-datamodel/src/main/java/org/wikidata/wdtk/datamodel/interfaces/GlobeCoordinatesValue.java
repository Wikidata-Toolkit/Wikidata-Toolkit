/**
 * Globe coordinates specify a position on some globe (usually Earth, but
 * possibly also another celestial body, such as Mars).
 * 
 * Altitude is not currently supported by Wikibase.
 * 
 * All numeric data in coordinates is represented by double-precision floating
 * point numbers. This results in limited precision, but this is acceptable
 * here, because (1) coordinates are naturally of limited precision today,
 * already because the whole coordinate system makes simplifying assumptions
 * about the shape of the body it refers to; (2) exact calculations with
 * coordinates are not needed in most applications; (3) Wikibase uses
 * double-precision floats (based on PHP) internally for calculating with
 * coordinates as well; (4) exact comparisons of coordinate objects, although
 * rare in practice, should still work as expected. The one general problem with
 * any underlying number format is the conversion between degrees (with
 * fraction) and a degrees-minute-second view, which will always lead to a loss
 * in precision that one has to live with.
